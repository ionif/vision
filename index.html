  <h3>Vision Smartphone Passthrough Glasses <span style="font-weight:normal">by Alex Ionkov</span></h3>

  <h3>Goal</h3>
The goal of this project is to opensource Google Cardboard style glasses for WebXR development and use. Currently compatible with WebXR (WebVR), Aframe, Google Cardboard. Fits the iPhone 11, X or any phone of similar dimension (~5.95" by ~2.95" by ~0.35"). 
<hr>
I'm currently also using Google Mediapipe Handpose model to try and implement handtracking using the rear camera of the phone. The smartphone is powerful enough for these experiences but it hasn't really been harnessed yet.

<h3>Design and Prototyping</h3>

<br>
The ear support pieces are removable which means you can print multiple headsets for different phones and use the same ear support pieces for every one. Also allows you to travel with it easier.
<hr>
Chris Meyer at <a href="http://www.sector67.org/blog/">Sector67</a>, a local makerspace, was amazing to work with and more than happy to help me. He helped me understand the limits of FDM and other materials. His knowledge and experience helped me immensely. I wasn't allowed to use my university's (UW Madison) makerspace for personal projects.

<h3>Info</h3>
I worked on this project during the Fall of 2020. Design and development till the last prototype took two months from the end of September to the end of November.

<h3>Contribution</h3>
Anyone interested in adjusting the models for other phones is welcome to! It would be awesome, if you create a push request afterwards, with the changes in a branch named the specific model phone! Remixes are welcome but must be open source as well however, due to the GPLv3 license.
